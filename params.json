It is typically used to clarify rare, nonstandard or ambiguous readings, or in children's or learners' materials.\r\n\r\nSimply put, you could know how to *read* a certain word in Japanese but that doesn't necessarily mean that you know how to pronounce it. To solve this problem, publishers use furigana to tell the reader how a particular word is pronounced.\r\n\r\nA Japanese sentence looks like this:\r\n\r\n林さんは英語は話せます。\r\n\r\nTo add a phonetic guide it is common practice to include the pronunciations between parenthesis right after the kanji, like this:\r\n\r\n林（はやし）さんは英語（えいご）は話（はな）せます。\r\n\r\nWhile this makes pronunciations very clear it makes the text less readable.\r\n\r\nThis module takes furigana entered in the above format and converts it to proper HTML using **ruby**, **rb**, **rp**, and **rt** tags. This will turn the above sentence into this:\r\n\r\n    <ruby><rb>林</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>はやし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>さんは<ruby><rb>英語</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>えいご</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>は<ruby><rb>話</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>はな</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>せます。\r\n\r\nSupported browsers (like Chrome) will render it like this:\r\n\r\n![Rendered furigana](http://julianvidal.com/images/furigana.png)\r\n\r\nAnd a nice advantage is that browsers that don't support ruby text will degrade gracefully and render your text exactly as you entered it. Actually the text will *look* the same but since the furigana will now be wrapped in its own tags, you will be able to style them the way you want. You couldn't have done this without ruby tags. So as you see the **ruby** tag has its benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo install JVFurigana you can clone this repository into your ZF2 modules directory. Don't forget to enable it in your `config/application.config.php` file. \r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nFrom within a view script, you can do:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?=$this->jvfurigana('こんにちは世界（せかい）'); ?>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\nSee the github FAQ page.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nJVFurigana is released under the Apache license.
